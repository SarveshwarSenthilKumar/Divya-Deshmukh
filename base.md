Here’s a clean, date-ordered rundown of Divya Deshmukh’s major chess milestones (tournament wins, titles, team medals, and other widely reported achievements). I focused on events with reliable records; if you want me to dig into specific years for local/state events and age-group podiums, say the word and I’ll extend this.

## Notes & sourcing

* I prioritized primary/authoritative chess outlets (FIDE, Chess.com, ChessBase) and leading Indian media for key wins, plus Wikipedia when it aggregates those with references. The **five most important claims** above—**2025 World Cup + GM**, **2024 Olympiad double gold**, **2024 World Junior**, **2023 TSCI Rapid**, and **2022 National title**—are cited to primary reports. If you want, I can append tournament-by-tournament cross-tables, PGNs of notable wins, or a longer pre-2014 section (national/Asian age-group medals).
